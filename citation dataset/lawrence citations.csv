In previous work using several examples, it has been shown that imbalance can exert a major impact on the value and meaning of accuracy and on certain other well-known performance metrics. In this paper, our approach goes beyond simply studying case studies and develops a systematic analysis of this impact by simulating the results obtained using binary classifiers. A set of functions and numerical indicators are attained which enables the comparison of the behaviour of several performance metrics based on the binary confusion matrix when they are faced with imbalanced datasets. Throughout the paper, a new way to measure the imbalance is defined which surpasses the Imbalance Ratio used in previous studies. From the simulation results, several clusters of performance metrics have been identified that involve the use of Geometric Mean or Bookmaker Informedness as the best null-biased metrics if their focus on classification successes (dismissing the errors) presents no limitation for the specific application where they are used. However, if classification errors must also be considered, then the Matthews Correlation Coefficient arises as the best choice. Finally, a set of null-biased multi-perspective Class Balance Metrics is proposed which extends the concept of Class Balance Accuracy to other performance metrics.","2019-07-01","2022-03-22 07:36:23","2022-03-22 07:36:23","2022-03-22 07:36:23","216-231","","","91","","Pattern Recognition","","","","","","","","en","","","","","ScienceDirect","","","","/Users/mac/Zotero/storage/SRP7DGSE/Luque et al. - 2019 - The impact of class imbalance in classification pe.pdf; /Users/mac/Zotero/storage/LKNNF4QI/S0031320319300950.html","","","Class Balance Metrics; Classification; Imbalanced datasets; Performance measures","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

This attention has been mostly focused on two-classes problems. Fewer solutions exist for the multi-classes imbalance problem. From an evaluation point of view, the class imbalance problem is challenging because a non-uniform importance is assigned to the classes. In this paper, we propose a relevance-based evaluation framework that incorporates user preferences by allowing the assignment of differentiated importance values to each class. The presented solution is able to overcome difficulties detected in existing measures and increases discrimination capability. The proposed framework requires the assignment of a relevance score to the problem classes. To deal with cases where the user is not able to specify each class relevance, we describe three mechanisms to incorporate the existing domain knowledge into the relevance framework. These mechanisms differ in the amount of information available and assumptions made regarding the domain. They also allow the use of our framework in common settings of multi-class imbalanced problems with different levels of information available.","2017","2022-03-22 07:40:30","2022-03-22 07:40:30","","698-710","","","","","","","Lecture Notes in Computer Science","","","","Springer International Publishing","Cham","en","","","","","Springer Link","","","","/Users/mac/Zotero/storage/KFBE8T9U/Branco et al. - 2017 - Relevance-Based Evaluation Metrics for Multi-class.pdf","","","","Kim, Jinho; Shim, Kyuseok; Cao, Longbing; Lee, Jae-Gil; Lin, Xuemin; Moon, Yang-Sae","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Existing localization techniques, however, often cannot reliably distinguish between tagged objects that are close to the border of adjacent areas. Against this backdrop, we present a hybrid approach based on an ANN and a HMM that leverages not only low-level RFID data streams but also information about physical constraints and process knowledge and thus incorporates scene dynamics. We experimentally demonstrate the performance of our approach considering a RFID-based smart fitting room which is a practically relevant application with limited process control in an environment with strong multipath reflections and non-line-of-sight effects. Our results show that our approach is able to reliably distinguish between tagged objects within different cabins.

These fine-grained signals carry sensitive information about users, which has raised serious concerns from the privacy viewpoint. In this paper, we focus on real-time privacy threats, i.e., potential attackers that try to infer sensitive information from SMs data in an online fashion. We adopt an information-theoretic privacy measure and show that it effectively limits the performance of any attacker. Then, we propose a general formulation to design a privatization mechanism that can provide a target level of privacy by adding a minimal amount of distortion to the SMs measurements. On the other hand, to cope with different applications, a flexible distortion measure is considered. This formulation leads to a general loss function, which is optimized using a deep learning adversarial framework, where two neural networks -referred to as the releaser and the adversary- are trained with opposite goals. An exhaustive empirical study is then performed to validate the performance of the proposed approach and compare it with state-of-the-art methods for the occupancy detection privacy problem. Finally, we also investigate the impact of data mismatch between the releaser and the attacker.","2020-11","2022-03-22 08:11:15","2022-03-22 08:11:15","","5174-5183","","6","11","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","IEEE Xplore","","Conference Name: IEEE Transactions on Smart Grid","","/Users/mac/Zotero/storage/XW45KJ9J/Shateri et al. - 2020 - Real-Time Privacy-Preserving Data Release for Smar.pdf","","","adversarial training; Data privacy; deep learning; directed information; Distortion; Distortion measurement; long-short term memory (LSTM) cell; Power measurement; Privacy; Privacy-preserving mechanism; privacy-utility trade-off; Real-time systems; recurrent neural networks; smart meters privacy; time series data; Training","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

This study explores the feasibility of assessing PwMS and Healthy Control's (HC) physical function by characterising gaitrelated features, which can be modelled using machine learning (ML) techniques to correctly distinguish subgroups of PwMS from healthy controls. A total of 97 subjects (24 HC subjects, 52 mildly disabled (PwMSmild, EDSS [0-3]) and 21 moderately disabled (PwMSmod, EDSS [3.5- 5.5]) contributed data which was recorded from a TwoMinute Walk Test (2MWT) performed out-of-clinic and daily over a 24-week period. Signal-based features relating to movement were extracted from sensors in smartphone and smartwatch devices. A large number of features (n = 156) showed fair-to-strong (R > 0.3) correlations with clinical outcomes. LASSO feature selection was applied to select and rank subsets of features used for dichotomous classification between subject groups, which were compared using Logistic Regression (LR), Support Vector Machines (SVM) and Random Forest (RF) models. Classifications of subject types were compared using data obtained from smartphone, smartwatch and the fusion of features from both devices. Models built on smartphone features alone achieved the highest classification performance, indicating that accurate and remote measurement of the ambulatory characteristics of HC and PwMS can be achieved with only one device. It was observed however that smartphonebased performance was affected by inconsistent placement location (running belt versus pocket). Results show that PwMSmod could be distinguished from HC subjects (Acc. 82.2 ± 2.9%, Sen. 80.1 ± 3.9%, Spec. 87.2 ± 4.2%, F1 84.3 ± 3.8), and PwMSmild (Acc. 82.3 ± 1.9%, Sen. 71.6 ± 4.2%, Spec. 87.0 ± 3.2%, F1 75.1 ± 2.2) using an SVM classifier with a Radial Basis Function (RBF). PwMSmild were shown to exhibit HC-like behaviour and were thus less distinguishable from HC (Acc. 66.4 ± 4.5%, Sen. 67.5 ± 5.7%, Spec. 60.3 ± 6.7%, F1 58.6 ± 5.8).

Monitoring patients with these diseases involves the observation of peripheral blood samples under a microscope, a time-consuming procedure. Moreover, a specialist is required to perform this technique, and owing to the subjective nature of the observation of isolated RBCs, the error rate is high. In this paper, we propose an automated method for differentially enumerating RBCs that uses peripheral blood smear image analysis. In this method, the objects of interest in the image are segmented using a Chan-Vese active contour model. An analysis is then performed to classify the RBCs, also called erythrocytes, as normal or elongated or having other deformations, using the basic shape analysis descriptors: circular shape factor (CSF) and elliptical shape factor (ESF). To analyze cells that become partially occluded in a cluster during sample preparation, an elliptical adjustment is performed to allow the analysis of erythrocytes with discoidal and elongated shapes. The images of patient blood samples used in the study were acquired by a clinical laboratory specialist in the Special Hematology Department of the “Dr. Juan Bruno Zayas” General Hospital in Santiago de Cuba. A comparison of the results obtained by the proposed method in our experiments with those obtained by some state-of-the-art methods showed that the proposed method is superior for the diagnosis of sickle cell anemia. This superiority is achieved for evidenced by the obtained F-measure value (0.97 for normal cells and 0.95 for elongated ones) and several overall multiclass performance measures. The results achieved by the proposed method are suitable for the purpose of clinical treatment and diagnostic support of sickle cell anemia.","2020-06-01","2022-03-22 08:12:24","2022-03-22 08:12:24","2022-03-22 08:12:24","1265-1284","","6","58","","Med Biol Eng Comput","","","","","","","","en","","","","","Springer Link","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

However, grasslands are today one of the most endangered ecosystems due to land use change, agricultural intensification, land abandonment as well as climate change. The present study explores the performance of a knowledge-driven GEOgraphic-Object—based Image Analysis (GEOBIA) learning scheme to classify Very High Resolution (VHR) images for natural grassland ecosystem mapping. The classification was applied to a Natura 2000 protected area in Southern Italy. The Food and Agricultural Organization Land Cover Classification System (FAO-LCCS) hierarchical scheme was instantiated in the learning phase of the algorithm. Four multi-temporal WorldView-2 (WV-2) images were classified by combining plant phenology and agricultural practices rules with prior-image spectral knowledge. Drawing on this knowledge, spectral bands and entropy features from one single date (Post Peak of Biomass) were firstly used for multiple-scale image segmentation into Small Objects (SO) and Large Objects (LO). Thereafter, SO were labelled by considering spectral and context-sensitive features from the whole multi-seasonal data set available together with ancillary data. Lastly, the labelled SO were overlaid to LO segments and, in turn, the latter were labelled by adopting FAO-LCCS criteria about the SOs presence dominance in each LO. Ground reference samples were used only for validating the SO and LO output maps. The knowledge driven GEOBIA classifier for SO classification obtained an OA value of 97.35% with an error of 0.04. For LO classification the value was 75.09% with an error of 0.70. At SO scale, grasslands ecosystem was classified with 92.6%, 99.9% and 96.1% of User’s, Producer’s Accuracy and F1-score, respectively. The findings reported indicate that the knowledge-driven approach not only can be applied for (semi)natural grasslands ecosystem mapping in vast and not accessible areas but can also reduce the costs of ground truth data acquisition. The approach used may provide different level of details (small and large objects in the scene) but also indicates how to design and validate local conservation policies.","2020-01","2022-03-22 08:12:44","2022-03-22 08:12:44","2022-03-22 08:12:44","1447","","9","12","","","","","","","","","","en","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/","","","","www.mdpi.com","","Number: 9 Publisher: Multidisciplinary Digital Publishing Institute","","/Users/mac/Zotero/storage/S5UJ6TF9/Adamo et al. - 2020 - Knowledge-Based Classification of Grassland Ecosys.pdf; /Users/mac/Zotero/storage/D7C72VW7/1447.html","","","expert knowledge; grasslands ecosystems; object-based classification; Very High Resolution (VHR)","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Slums are defined by the United Nations (UN) as informal settlements or areas deprived of access to water, sanitation and durable housing. The buildings in slums are overcrowded and lack land tenure security. Slum-identification studies are very much driven by the persistence and growth of slums and the emergence of new slums being inexorably part of contemporary urbanization processes, particularly in the global south where rapid slum development is linked to the failure of formal land markets and low planning capacity. Identifying slums is an import aspect in urban environments of mega-cities. The information on location, boundaries and population in informal settlements is of great need for social economic studies and thus providing beneficial insight for a sustainable urban development. Beyond the identification of informal settlements and their physical parameters it is of great interest to provide these areas with an optimal fresh water-pipe infrastructure, since their supply of water is very limited. The view from above using remote sensing data makes it possible to grasp the physical spatial settlement structures and, accordingly, to approach the characterizing parameters of slums and with this in mind image class segmentation on slum mapping can be done using different approaches. In recent years mainly object based, machine learning and texture classification approaches have been used to identify slums in urban areas. Regular machine learning tasks are limited because of their manually designed features. Another disadvantage of those methods is the inability to transfer the classifier to different datasets. This study provides a combination of methods in deep learning to achieve respectable accuracies in mapping informal settlements. Detected slums provide the prerequisite for establishing an optimal water supply network for all informal settlements. Since this procedure depends very much on the input geo-data, multiple ways of slum mapping using deep convolutional neural networks are presented and the cost of an optimal water-pipe network supplying all slum dwellers with water is calculated for Mumbai and Delhi. Class segmentation performance was evaluated using overall and class based accuracy metrics. Using a pre-trained fully convolutional network resulted in an overall Pixel Accuracy for informal settlements of 78% and a mean Intersection over Union of 68%, while fine-tuned FCNs could achieve an overall Pixel Accuracy for informal settlements of 75% and a mean intersection over union of 63%. Using the best performing FCN a water supply infrastructure was built optimized to the shortest path connecting all slums using different approaches. The investment of a pipeline network providing clean water would cost about 16 million e for Mumbai and 12 million e for Delhi after 10 years of operation.","2018-02","2022-03-22 08:18:13","2022-03-22 08:18:13","2022-03-22 08:18:13","","91","","","","","","","","","","Technische Universität München","","de","","masters","","","elib.dlr.de","","","","/Users/mac/Zotero/storage/GYFBNGWQ/Stark - 2018 - Using Deep Convolutional Neural Networks for the I.pdf; /Users/mac/Zotero/storage/U4VGAPSN/119019.html","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The machine learning methods can be used—by extracting new insights from available biological data sets, and provide further guidance for experimental studies. This study identifies the most relevant highly surface-specific features that might be responsible for cytotoxic behavior of 2D materials, especially MXenes. In particular, two factors, namely, the presence of transition metal oxides and lithium atoms on the surface, are identified as cytotoxicity-generating features. The developed machine learning model succeeds in predicting toxicity for other 2D MXenes, previously not tested in vitro, and hence, is able to complement the existing knowledge coming from in vitro studies. Thus, we claim that it might be one of the solutions for reducing the number of toxicological studies needed, and allows for minimizing failures in future biological applications.","2020-01","2022-03-22 08:23:00","2022-03-22 08:23:00","2022-03-22 08:23:00","3083","","14","13","","","","","","","","","","en","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/","","","","www.mdpi.com","","Number: 14 Publisher: Multidisciplinary Digital Publishing Institute","","/Users/mac/Zotero/storage/7F5TXZTZ/Marchwiany et al. - 2020 - Surface-Related Features Responsible for Cytotoxic.pdf; /Users/mac/Zotero/storage/IJAA6ZA9/3083.html","","","machine learning; cytotoxicity; MXenes; van der Waals layered materials","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

As such, the development of optical remote sensing techniques to measure snow-covered area (SCA) has enabled progress in a wide variety of research domains. However, in many cases, the spatial and temporal resolutions of currently available remotely sensed SCA products are insufficient to capture SCA evolution at spatial and temporal resolutions relevant to the study of fine-scale spatially heterogeneous phenomena. We developed a convolutional neural network-based method to identify snow covered area using the ~3 m, 4-band PlanetScope optical satellite image dataset with ~daily, near-global coverage. By comparing our model performance to snow extent derived from high-resolution airborne lidar differential depth measurements and satellite platforms in two North American sites (Sierra Nevada, CA, USA and Rocky Mountains, CO, USA), we show that these emerging image archives have great potential to accurately observe snow-covered area at high spatial and temporal resolutions despite limited radiometric bandwidth and band placement. We achieve average snow classification F-Scores of 0.73 in our training basin and 0.67 in a climatically-distinct out-of-sample basin, suggesting opportunities for model transferability. We also evaluate the performance of these data in forested regions, suggesting avenues for further research.

The value of such data are enhanced when the specific dementia stage is identified. Objective: We aimed to develop a supervised machine learning algorithm to classify dementia stages based on tracked symptoms. Methods: We employed clinical data from 717 people from 3 sources: (1) a memory clinic; (2) long-term care; and (3) an open-label trial of donepezil in vascular and mixed dementia (VASPECT). Symptoms were captured with SymptomGuide Dementia. A clinician classified participants into 4 groups using either the Functional Assessment Staging Test or the Global Deterioration Scale as mild cognitive impairment, mild dementia, moderate dementia, or severe dementia. Individualized symptom profiles from the pooled data were used to train machine learning models to predict dementia severity. Models trained with 6 different machine learning algorithms were compared using nested cross-validation to identify the best performing model. Model performance was assessed using measures of balanced accuracy, precision, recall, Cohen κ, area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROC), and area under the precision-recall curve (AUPRC). The best performing algorithm was used to train a model optimized for balanced accuracy. Results: The study population was mostly female (424/717, 59.1%), older adults (mean 77.3 years, SD 10.6, range 40-100) with mild to moderate dementia (332/717, 46.3%). Age, duration of symptoms, 37 unique dementia symptoms, and 10 symptom-derived variables were used to distinguish dementia stages. A model trained with a support vector machine learning algorithm using a one-versus-rest approach showed the best performance. The correct dementia stage was identified with 83% balanced accuracy (Cohen κ=0.81, AUPRC 0.91, AUROC 0.96). The best performance was seen when classifying severe dementia (AUROC 0.99). Conclusions: A supervised machine learning algorithm exhibited excellent performance in identifying dementia stages based on dementia symptoms reported in an online environment. This novel dementia staging algorithm can be used to describe dementia stage based on user-reported symptoms. This type of symptom recording offers real-world data that reflect important symptoms in people with dementia.","2020-11-11","2022-03-22 08:26:46","2022-03-22 08:26:46","2022-03-22 08:26:46","e20840","","11","22","","","Use of Patient-Reported Symptoms from an Online Symptom Tracking Tool for Dementia Severity Staging","","","","","","","EN","","","","","www.jmir.org","","Company: Journal of Medical Internet Research Distributor: Journal of Medical Internet Research Institution: Journal of Medical Internet Research Label: Journal of Medical Internet Research Publisher: JMIR Publications Inc., Toronto, Canada","","/Users/mac/Zotero/storage/Q2J65WIY/Shehzad et al. - 2020 - Use of Patient-Reported Symptoms from an Online Sy.pdf; /Users/mac/Zotero/storage/5P7EHMWQ/e20840.html","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

This strategy can unnecessarily complicate the model selection and evaluation in imbalance datasets. In this paper, we introduce a new metric, imbalance accuracy metric (IAM), that can be used as a solo measure for model evaluation and selection.

To help land and fire management agencies manage and mitigate wildfire-related risks, we need to develop tools for mapping those risks. Big geodata—in the form of remotely sensed images, ground-based sensor observations, and topographical datasets—can help us characterize the dynamics of wildfire related events. In this study, we design a deep fully convolutional network, called AllConvNet, to produce daily maps of the probability of a wildfire burn over the next 7 days. We applied it to burns in Victoria, Australia for the period of 2006–2017. Fifteen factors that were extracted from six different datasets and resulted into 29 quantitative features, were selected as input to the network. We compared it with three baseline methods: SegNet, multilayer perceptron, and logistic regression. AllConvNet outperforms the other three baseline methods in four of the six quantitative metrics considered. AllConvNet and SegNet provide smoother and more regularized predicted maps, with SegNet providing greater sensitivity in dificriminating less wildfire-prone locations. Input feature statistical importance was measured for all the networks and compared against logistic regression coefficients. Total precipitation, lightning flash density, and land surface temperature occur to be consistently highly weighted by all models while terrain aspect components, wind direction components, certain land cover classes (such as crop field and woodland), and distance from power lines are ranked on the lower end. We conclude that wild-fire burn prediction methods based on deep learning present quantitative and qualitative gains.","2021-08-01","2022-03-22 08:28:11","2022-03-22 08:28:11","2022-03-22 08:28:11","105276","","","140","","Safety Science","","","","","","","","en","","","","","ScienceDirect","","","","/Users/mac/Zotero/storage/AYFHDQYD/S0925753521001211.html","","","Big geodata; Convolutional networks; Deep learning; Input statistical importance; Wildfire burn prediction","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

This paper studies the impact of Side Information (SI) on the performance of possible attacks to real-time privacy-preserving algorithms for SMs. In particular, we consider a deep adversarial learning framework, in which the desired releaser, which is a Recurrent Neural Network (RNN), is trained by fighting against an adversary network until convergence. To define the objective for training, two different approaches are considered: the Causal Adversarial Learning (CAL) and the Directed Information (DI)-based learning. The main difference between these approaches relies on how the privacy term is measured during the training process. The releaser in the CAL method, disposing of supervision from the actual values of the private variables and feedback from the adversary performance, tries to minimize the adversary log-likelihood. On the other hand, the releaser in the DI approach completely relies on the feedback received from the adversary and is optimized to maximize its uncertainty. The performance of these two algorithms is evaluated empirically using real-world SMs data, considering an attacker with access to SI (e.g., the day of the week) that tries to infer the occupancy status from the released SMs data. The results show that, although they perform similarly when the attacker does not exploit the SI, in general, the CAL method is less sensitive to the inclusion of SI. However, in both cases, privacy levels are significantly affected, particularly when multiple sources of SI are included.","2020-11","2022-03-22 08:28:19","2022-03-22 08:28:19","","1-6","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","IEEE Xplore","","","","/Users/mac/Zotero/storage/YIMEZTYJ/9302948.html; /Users/mac/Zotero/storage/6YQ84VAQ/Shateri et al. - 2020 - On the Impact of Side Information on Smart Meter P.pdf","","","Data privacy; Privacy; Training; Optimization; Power demand; Random variables; Smart grids","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2020 IEEE International Conference on Communications, Control, and Computing Technologies for Smart Grids (SmartGridComm)","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

This article proposes a probabilistic graphical model approach, in the form of a cluster graph, to boost geospatial classifications and produce a more accurate and robust classification and uncertainty product. Cluster graphs can be characterized as a means of reasoning about geospatial data such as land cover classifications by considering the effects of spatial distribution, and inter-class dependencies in a computationally efficient manner. To assess the capabilities of our proposed cluster graph boosting approach, we apply it to the field of land cover classification. We make use of existing land cover products (GlobeLand30, CORINE Land Cover) along with data from Volunteered Geographic Information (VGI), namely OpenStreetMap (OSM), to generate a boosted land cover classification and the respective uncertainty estimates. Our approach combines qualitative and quantitative components through the application of our probabilistic graphical model and subjective expert judgments. Evaluating our approach on a test region in Garmisch-Partenkirchen, Germany, our approach was able to boost the overall land cover classification accuracy by 1.4% when compared to an independent reference land cover dataset. Our approach was shown to be robust and was able to produce a diverse, feasible and spatially consistent land cover classification in areas of incomplete and conflicting evidence. On an independent validation scene, we demonstrated that our cluster graph boosting approach was generalizable even when initialized with poor prior assumptions.","2019-03","2022-03-22 08:30:57","2022-03-22 08:30:57","2022-03-22 08:30:57","10","","1","4","","","","","","","","","","en","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/","","","","www.mdpi.com","","Number: 1 Publisher: Multidisciplinary Digital Publishing Institute","","/Users/mac/Zotero/storage/Q72WLWXX/Hughes et al. - 2019 - A Cluster Graph Approach to Land Cover Classificat.pdf; /Users/mac/Zotero/storage/Q9274Z3Z/10.html","","","classification; cluster graphs; crowdsourcing data; land cover; OSM; probabilistic graphical models","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The challenges such as imbalanced multi-class bias for discrete decoding (classification), online computing cost and dynamic analysis of results in time are considered. There are two main objectives of the study: identifying the best suited performances metrics according to the requirements and combining several levels of evaluation in the whole BCI system (decoder and patient oriented). The main novelty of the study is the combination of several common metrics with new temporal metrics and a time dynamic approach which allows adequately reflect the performance of adaptive dynamic and hierarchical discrete-continuous brain-computer interfaces BCI systems.

"2T5QQ75Z","thesis","2017","Weigand, Matthias","SAR Image Feature Analysis for Slum Detection in Megacities","","","","","https://elib.dlr.de/111835/","Urban areas have undergone major changes in the last decades. Especially in developing countries, megacities with more than 10 million inhabitants have developed. The number of such huge urban agglomerations is predicted to rise to 41 until 2030. The increasing influx of urban dwellers inevitably leads to the formation of informal settlements with poor living conditions. Monitoring, analysis and mapping of slums are necessary to provide information about such settlements and thus tackle these increasing challenges. Therefore, SAR remote sensing images are used in this study for an extensive mapping of slums conducted in Mumbai, India. In a broad experimental setup textural and morphological features are analyzed for the slum discrimination in an urban landscape. Two state-of-the-art supervised classification algorithms are compared in the experiments. By utilizing an area-wide reference data set, detailed accuracy assessment techniques are applied to determine the classification quality. The results indicate that it is possible to classify the urban landscape by using textural image features with an Overall Accuracy of 88.58% utilizing a Random Forest classifier. However, lower class specific accuracies of the slum areas show that slum mapping remains challenging. A patch based accuracy assessment proves that it is most difficult to detect small slum areas in the urban landscape. Furthermore, an experimental feature reduction experiment indicates that more image features are needed to detect slums than to discriminate urban and non-urban landscapes.","2017-02","2022-03-22 08:32:30","2022-03-22 08:32:30","2022-03-22 08:32:30","","55","","","","","","","","","","Universität Augsburg","","en","","masters","","","elib.dlr.de","","","","/Users/mac/Zotero/storage/JSAFAF4G/Weigand - 2017 - SAR Image Feature Analysis for Slum Detection in M.pdf; /Users/mac/Zotero/storage/9AM27GUC/111835.html","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

A recent, popular approach to address these privacy concerns is to employ evasion attacks against the metric embedding networks powering face recognition systems. Face obfuscation systems generate imperceptible perturbations, when added to an image, cause the face recognition system to misidentify the user. The key to these approaches is the generation of perturbations using a pre-trained metric embedding network followed by their application to an online system, whose model might be proprietary. This dependence of face obfuscation on metric embedding networks, which are known to be unfair in the context of face recognition, surfaces the question of demographic fairness -- \textit{are there demographic disparities in the performance of face obfuscation systems?} To address this question, we perform an analytical and empirical exploration of the performance of recent face obfuscation systems that rely on deep embedding networks. We find that metric embedding networks are demographically aware; they cluster faces in the embedding space based on their demographic attributes. We observe that this effect carries through to face obfuscation systems: faces belonging to minority groups incur reduced utility compared to those from majority groups. For example, the disparity in average obfuscation success rate on the online Face++ API can reach up to 20 percentage points. We present an intuitive analytical model to provide insights into these phenomena.","2021-10-19","2022-03-22 08:32:45","2022-03-22 08:32:45","2022-03-22 08:32:45","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","arXiv.org","","arXiv: 2108.02707","","/Users/mac/Zotero/storage/UBBFC96T/Rosenberg et al. - 2021 - Fairness Properties of Face Recognition and Obfusc.pdf; /Users/mac/Zotero/storage/JDDQPQTM/2108.html","","","Computer Science - Artificial Intelligence; Computer Science - Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

We will compare and assess three main methods of handling datasets with mixed features, including the use of encoding methods, the combination of the GFMM model with other classifiers, and employing the specific learning algorithms for both types of features. The experimental results showed that the target and James–Stein are appropriate categorical encoding methods for learning algorithms of GFMM models, while the combination of GFMM neural networks and decision trees is a flexible way to enhance the classification performance of GFMM models on datasets with the mixed features. The learning algorithms with the mixed-type feature abilities are potential approaches to deal with mixed-attribute data in a natural way, but they need further improvement to achieve a better classification accuracy.

In addition, it has benefited the users by giving them more control over their electricity consumption. However, it is well-known that it also discloses sensitive information about the users, i.e., an attacker can infer users' private information by analyzing the SMs data. In this study, we propose a privacy-preserving approach based on non-uniform down-sampling of SMs data. We formulate this as the problem of learning a sparse representation of SMs data with minimum information leakage and maximum utility. The architecture is composed of a releaser, which is a recurrent neural network (RNN), that is trained to generate the sparse representation by masking the SMs data, and an utility and adversary networks (also RNNs), which help the releaser to minimize the leakage of information about the private attribute, while keeping the reconstruction error of the SMs data minimum (i.e., maximum utility). The performance of the proposed technique is assessed based on actual SMs data and compared with uniform down-sampling, random (non-uniform) down-sampling, as well as the state-of-the-art in privacy-preserving methods using a data manipulation approach. It is shown that our method performs better in terms of the privacy-utility trade-off while releasing much less data, thus also being more efficient.","2021-10","2022-03-22 08:41:29","2022-03-22 08:41:29","","333-338","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","IEEE Xplore","","","","/Users/mac/Zotero/storage/MAXJWGN5/9632285.html; /Users/mac/Zotero/storage/T9VGTSX2/Shateri et al. - 2021 - Learning Sparse Privacy-Preserving Representations.pdf","","","Conferences; Feature extraction; Computers; Fault detection; Load forecasting; Power quality; Recurrent neural networks","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021 IEEE International Conference on Communications, Control, and Computing Technologies for Smart Grids (SmartGridComm)","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Furthermore, frequently the goal of the final system is to obtain very high precision for each of the concepts. All of these factors contribute to the complexity of the task and increase the difficulty of building a quality data model by learning algorithms. One of the ways of addressing these challenges are so-called binarization strategies, which allow for decomposition of the multi-class problem into several binary tasks with lower complexity. Because of the different decomposition schemes used by each of those methods, some of them are considered to be better suited for handling imbalanced data than the others. In this study, we focus on the well-known binary approaches, namely One-Vs-All, One-Vs-One, and Error-Correcting Output Codes, and their effectiveness in multi-class imbalanced data classification, with respect to the base classifiers and various aggregation schemes for each of the strategies. We compare the performance of these approaches and try to boost the performance of seemingly weaker methods by sampling algorithms. The detailed comparative experimental study of the considered methods, supported by the statistical analysis, is presented. The results show the differences among various binarization strategies. We show how one can mitigate those differences using simple oversampling methods.","2020","2022-03-22 08:42:21","2022-03-22 08:42:21","","141-155","","","","","","","Lecture Notes in Computer Science","","","","Springer International Publishing","Cham","en","","","","","Springer Link","","","","/Users/mac/Zotero/storage/GG4W48VG/Żak and Woźniak - 2020 - Performance Analysis of Binarization Strategies fo.pdf","","","Binarization strategies; Imbalanced data; Multi-class classification","Krzhizhanovskaya, Valeria V.; Závodszky, Gábor; Lees, Michael H.; Dongarra, Jack J.; Sloot, Peter M.

The contribution of this paper is to suggest a new approach for dealing with class imbalance, overlapping, and noise in multi-class. This is accomplished by employing minimizing overlapping selection (MOSS) as an ensemble learning algorithm and a preprocessing technique in HAR-MI, as well as employing multi-class combination cleaning and resampling (MC-CCR) as a resampling algorithm at the processing stage.

Second, we select regions with higher curvature and we apply a recursive algorithm to refine the previous selected regions. Finally, we obtain a concave point from each region based on the analysis of the relative position of their neighbourhood We experimentally demonstrated that a better concave points detection implies a better cluster division.

"N3IRUS4Y","thesis","2019","Tang, Junqing","Quantitative Assessment of Resilience in Complex Systems","","","","","https://www.research-collection.ethz.ch/handle/20.500.11850/353417","Complex systems, such as financial systems and infrastructure systems, are facing an increasing number of disruptions, either external (e.g., financial crisis and natural disasters) or internal (e.g., degradation, aging, and ill performance). Many previous works have dedicated to the question of how to measure the resilience in these complex systems. To date, system resilience can be assessed in various ways, i.e., qualitative or quantitative, summative or formative, and target-based or purpose-based. This thesis focuses on quantitative methods and makes contributions on filling research gaps and improving the up-to-date toolkits in three categories of resilience assessment tools, namely (1) Performance-based metrics; (2) Network-based approaches; And (3) Probability-based graphic models.  For performance-based metrics, critical system functions, such as tolerance thresholds for different level of degradation, are absent in the construction of these tools, and the metrics' applicability in complex performance is less developed. Therefore, Chapter 2 aims to develop a generic resilience metric for quantitative assessment based on system functions and test its strength in the complex performance of stock markets. The proposed metric satisfactorily characterized the markets’ resilient behaviors and had comparative advantages throughout the analysis.  In network-based studies, one of the significant missing links in network resilience (specifically in temporal networks) is the relationship between the resilience of individual components (nodes or edges) and the dynamic interdependence of networks (dynamic changes in the topology of temporal networks). Thus, Chapter 3 and 4 was designed in a progressive manner where Chapter 3 acts as a pilot study, aiming to characterize individual resilience using complex network approach and explore the descriptive strength of multiple associated factors. Chapter 4 is a further study, aiming to develop a set of statistical models to identify individuals' resilient performance in a networked environment and perform in-depth analyses and forecasts. Taking London stock exchange as study objective, Chapter 3 found that the survivability resilience of individual stocks was correlated with node degree and node strength. This was further confirmed by Chapter 4, whose results showed that the survivability resilience could be described and approximated by degree-related centrality measures. In addition, the statistical models proposed in Chapter 4 offers an effective tool that can be used to predict different individual stock's resilient performance in the networked market.  Lastly, Chapter 5 proposes a hierarchical Bayesian network model with ontologically identified interdependence among resilience functions and system qualities. Based on current literature, the ontology-oriented Bayesian networks have been rarely applied to model system resilience, and the investigations on the dynamic resilience are still needed. Therefore, Chapter 5 aims to develop a probability-based graphic model to quantify the dynamic resilience. The chapter takes Beijing's road transportation system as a case study and studies the dynamic resilience of the system from 1997 to 2016 by fusing multi-source and heterogeneous urban data. The analysis found that Beijing’s road system was not as resilient as expected, with the probability of being resilient between 50% and 70%. Moreover, the critical system qualities that mostly affect its dynamic resilience have been identified as well. The model proposed in this chapter is a promising tool for resilience assessments.  The main value of this thesis is to improve our understandings about how to effectively measure and quantify resilience in complex systems with complex performance, dynamic interdependence, massive system topology, and probability caused by uncertainties. The thesis enriches the state-of-art assessing methods in resilience research by exploring possible measures and methodologies in quantitative approaches.

People living with HIV/AIDS (PLWHA) represent a paradigm of chronic patients where an e-health-based remote monitoring could have a significant impact in maintaining an adequate standard of care. The key objective of the study is to provide both an efficient operating model to “follow” the patient, capture the evolution of their disease, and establish proximity and relief through a remote collaborative model. These dimensions are collected through a dedicated mobile application that triggers questionnaires on the basis of decision-making algorithms, tagging patients and sending alerts to staff in order to tailor interventions. All outcomes and alerts are monitored and processed through an innovative e-Clinical platform. The processing of the collected data aims into learning and evaluating predictive models for the possible upcoming alerts on the basis of past data, using machine learning algorithms. The models will be clinically validated as the study collects more data, and, if successful, the resulting multidimensional vector of past attributes will act as a digital composite biomarker capable of predicting HIV-related alerts. Design: All PLWH > 18 sears old and stable disease followed at the outpatient services of a university hospital (n = 1500) will be enrolled in the interventional study. The study is ongoing, and patients are currently being recruited. Preliminary results are yielding monthly data to facilitate learning of predictive models for the alerts of interest. Such models are learnt for one or two months of history of the questionnaire data. In this manuscript, the protocol—including the rationale, detailed technical aspects underlying the study, and some preliminary results—are described. Conclusions: The management of HIV-infected patients in the pandemic era represents a challenge for future patient management beyond the pandemic period. The application of artificial intelligence and machine learning systems as described in this study could enable remote patient management that takes into account the real needs of the patient and the monitoring of the most relevant aspects of PLWH management today.","2022-02","2022-03-22 09:04:33","2022-03-22 09:04:33","2022-03-22 09:04:33","76","","2","13","","","HIV Patients’ Tracer for Clinical Assistance and Research during the COVID-19 Epidemic (INTERFACE)","","","","","","","en","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/","","","","www.mdpi.com","","Number: 2 Publisher: Multidisciplinary Digital Publishing Institute","","/Users/mac/Zotero/storage/RDER3HCD/Cingolani et al. - 2022 - HIV Patients’ Tracer for Clinical Assistance and R.pdf; /Users/mac/Zotero/storage/5NRNSGSS/76.html","","","COVID-19; e-Clinical assistance; HIV; outcome prediction","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The use of hyperbox fuzzy sets as fundamental representational and building blocks in learning algorithms forms an important branch of ML. Hyperbox-based algorithms have a huge potential for high scalability and incremental adaptation to applications working in the dynamically changing environments. Additionally, learning algorithms based on hyperbox representations can form interpretable models, which are highly desirable for areas with the requirement of safety and trust. This study aims to develop and expand robust, scalable, and transparent learning algorithms for hyperbox-based classification models with a specific focus on a general fuzzy min-max neural network (GFMMNN). First of all, a comprehensive survey on hyperbox-based machine learning models together with empirical assessments of the GFMMNN on pattern classification problems were conducted. Next, a new online learning algorithm was proposed for the GFMMNN and improved the robustness of the whole family of GFMMNN learning algorithms to work effectively with mixed-attribute data by introducing a new learning mechanism for categorical features. In terms of scalability, the main steps of the learning algorithms were reformulated so they can be effectively executed on graphics processing units using matrix operations, simultaneously proposing mathematical lemmas to reduce the redundancies of hyperbox candidates in the learning process. This thesis also proposed a novel method to enhance the transparency of classifiers while maintaining a good classification performance by using hierarchical granular representations from hyperbox fuzzy sets. The last contribution was a simple but powerful ensemble model built from many individual hyperbox-based classifiers trained on random subsets of both sample and feature spaces. Extensive empirical analyses indicated that the proposed solutions are highly competitive with other evaluated learning algorithms.","2021","2022-03-22 09:05:21","2022-03-22 09:05:21","2022-03-22 09:05:21","","","","","","","","","","","","","","en_US","info:eu-repo/semantics/openAccess","Thesis","","","opus.lib.uts.edu.au","","Accepted: 2022-02-22T00:57:59Z","","/Users/mac/Zotero/storage/IUUXM9NY/Khuat - 2021 - Development of Robust and Scalable Hyperbox based .pdf; /Users/mac/Zotero/storage/XBL866EG/154753.html","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The postulated concept integrates prior knowledge with learning from examples, thus allowing sensor devices to be used for the successful execution of machine learning even when the volume of training data is highly limited, using compact underlying hardware. The proposed architecture comprises two interacting functional modules arranged in a homogeneous, multiple-layer architecture. The first module, referred to as the knowledge sub-network, implements knowledge in the Conjunctive Normal Form through a three-layer structure composed of novel types of learnable units, called L-neurons. In contrast, the second module is a fully-connected conventional three-layer, feed-forward neural network, and it is referred to as a conventional neural sub-network. We show that the proposed hybrid structure successfully combines knowledge and learning, providing high recognition performance even for very limited training datasets, while also benefiting from an abundance of data, as it occurs for purely neural structures. In addition, since the proposed L-neurons can learn (through classical backpropagation), we show that the architecture is also capable of repairing its knowledge.","2021-01","2022-03-22 09:05:43","2022-03-22 09:05:43","2022-03-22 09:05:43","6168","","18","21","","","","","","","","","","en","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/","","","","www.mdpi.com","","Number: 18 Publisher: Multidisciplinary Digital Publishing Institute","","/Users/mac/Zotero/storage/C5QX652I/Łuczak et al. - 2021 - Boosting Intelligent Data Analysis in Smart Sensor.pdf; /Users/mac/Zotero/storage/E48AVMBR/6168.html","","","AI-enabled sensors; feedforward neural networks; hybrid systems; knowledge embedding","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Furthermore, frequently the goal of the ﬁnal system is to obtain very high precision for each of the concepts. All of these factors contribute to the complexity of the task and increase the diﬃculty of building a quality data model by learning algorithms. One of the ways of addressing these challenges are so-called binarization strategies, which allow for decomposition of the multi-class problem into several binary tasks with lower complexity. Because of the diﬀerent decomposition schemes used by each of those methods, some of them are considered to be better suited for handling imbalanced data than the others. In this study, we focus on the well-known binary approaches, namely One-Vs-All, One-Vs-One, and Error-Correcting Output Codes, and their eﬀectiveness in multiclass imbalanced data classiﬁcation, with respect to the base classiﬁers and various aggregation schemes for each of the strategies. We compare the performance of these approaches and try to boost the performance of seemingly weaker methods by sampling algorithms. The detailed comparative experimental study of the considered methods, supported by the statistical analysis, is presented. The results show the diﬀerences among various binarization strategies. We show how one can mitigate those diﬀerences using simple oversampling methods.","2020","2022-03-22 09:08:11","2022-03-22 09:08:11","2022-03-22 09:08:11","141-155","","","12140","","","","","","","","Springer International Publishing","Cham","en","","","","","DOI.org (Crossref)","","Series Title: Lecture Notes in Computer Science DOI: 10.1007/978-3-030-50423-6_11","","/Users/mac/Zotero/storage/9MVQT8WD/Żak and Woźniak - 2020 - Performance Analysis of Binarization Strategies fo.pdf","","","","Krzhizhanovskaya, Valeria V.; Závodszky, Gábor; Lees, Michael H.; Dongarra, Jack J.; Sloot, Peter M.

While it is common to use event-related potentials (ERPs) to distinguish neural activities representing different cognitive states, it does not allow us to explore single events because of its averaging nature. Classification of brain states associated with single events using real-time signals holds great potential for real-world applications such as brain-computer intervention systems that could support everyday learning. However, the progress in reaching high classification accuracy is still in early stages and thus, moving to the next step and creating such interventions is not possible yet. Moreover, previous studies applying classification methods to decode cognitive states have not typically compared different methods or explained the reasons for their choices. As a result, in this study, I systematically compared different methods of feature extraction, feature selection, and choice of classifier in the same study to investigate which methods work the best for decoding different episodic memory and perceptual “brain states.” Using an adult lifespan sample EEG dataset collected during encoding and retrieval of objects paired with color and scene contexts, I found that the Common Spatial Pattern (CSP)-based features could distinguish the trials of different memory classes (i.e. item remembered vs. forgotten; context correct vs. incorrect; red vs. green vs. brown context perception) better than other types of features (i.e., mean, variance, correlation, features based on AR model, and entropy), and the combination of filtering and sequential forward selection was the optimal method to select the effective features. Moreover, Bayesian classification performed better than other commonly used options (i.e., logistic regression, SVM, and LASSO). These methods were shown to outperform alternative approaches for an orthogonal dataset, supporting their generalizability. My systematic comparative analyses allow me to offer some recommendations for cognitive researchers to consider when applying machine learning based classification to their datasets.","2021-03-02","2022-03-22 09:50:12","2022-03-22 09:50:12","2022-03-22 09:50:12","","","","","","","","","","","","","","en_US","","","","","smartech.gatech.edu","","Accepted: 2021-06-10T16:49:45Z Publisher: Georgia Institute of Technology","","/Users/mac/Zotero/storage/CJPK974C/64669.html","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

As the amount of friction reduction correlates with the water film height covering the road surface, a quantification is of high relevance in order to improve traffic safety. Both drivers and autonomous vehicles would benefit from additional information. This paper presents a novel concept for road wetness quantification. It is based on a $2\times 4$ -planar capacitive transducer array, capable to detect water spray ejected by the tires and its wetness-related dependencies. The reliable assessment of these dependencies by a proposed capacitive sensor system is shown in an experimental study on an asphalt circuit for various wheel speeds. Besides the spray’s correlation with speed, the results reveal significant differences in transducer positions and designs confirming the array’s relevance regarding wetness quantification. In addition, a 1-nearest neighbor classifier capable of automatically distinguishing between eight wetness levels is proposed. The classifier is optimized by an extended version of balanced accuracy and reaches similar performance as binary classifiers from related research. A balanced ratio between capacitance increase-, standard deviation- and speed-related feature types is one key aspect of classifier performance. Furthermore, up to a certain extent, the array’s individual transducers can significantly contribute to classifier performance with design- and position-related advantages.","2021","2022-03-22 09:50:54","2022-03-22 09:50:54","","145498-145512","","","9","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","IEEE Xplore","","Conference Name: IEEE Access","","/Users/mac/Zotero/storage/H7289QG5/Döring et al. - 2021 - Road Surface Wetness Quantification Using a Capaci.pdf","","","Accidents; Capacitive sensors; driver assistance; Electrodes; Optical surface waves; road surface wetness detection; Roads; Tires; vehicle safety; Vehicles; wetness classification","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Rapid detection of fires is crucial for fire-extinguishing activities and rescue missions. Besides, mapping burned areas also supports evacuation and accessibility to emergency facilities. In this study, we propose a generic approach for detecting fires and burned areas based on machine learning (ML) approaches and remote sensing data. While most studies investigated either the detection of fires or mapping burned areas, we addressed and evaluated, in particular, the combined detection on three selected case study regions. Multispectral Sentinel-2 images represent the input data for the supervised ML models. First, we generated the reference data for the three target classes, burned, unburned, and fire, since no reference data were available. Second, the three regional fire datasets were preprocessed and divided into training, validation, and test subsets according to a defined schema. Furthermore, an undersampling approach ensured the balancing of the datasets. Third, seven selected supervised classification approaches were used and evaluated, including tree-based models, a self-organizing map, an artificial neural network, and a one-dimensional convolutional neural network (1D-CNN). All selected ML approaches achieved satisfying classification results. Moreover, they performed a highly accurate fire detection, while separating burned and unburned areas was slightly more challenging. The 1D-CNN and extremely randomized tree were the best-performing models with an overall accuracy score of 98% on the test subsets. Even on an unknown test dataset, the 1D-CNN achieved high classification accuracies. This generalization is even more valuable for any use-case scenario, including the organization of fire-fighting activities or civil protection. The proposed combined detection could be extended and enhanced with crowdsourced data in further studies.","2022-01","2022-03-22 09:53:56","2022-03-22 09:53:56","2022-03-22 09:53:56","657","","3","14","","","","","","","","","","en","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/","","","","www.mdpi.com","","Number: 3 Publisher: Multidisciplinary Digital Publishing Institute","","/Users/mac/Zotero/storage/EJQE53WV/Florath and Keller - 2022 - Supervised Machine Learning Approaches on Multispe.pdf; /Users/mac/Zotero/storage/6DZ9N2TM/657.html","","","deep learning; classification; burned area mapping; convolutional neural network; fire detection; imbalanced dataset; remote sensing; self-organizing maps; Sentinel-2 images; undersampling","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Experimental studies are time-consuming and expensive. Machine learning models can quickly predict the cytotoxicity of compounds, by extracting new insights from large materials and biological data sets, and provide further guidance for experimental studies. Results : Here, we identify the most relevant features that are responsible for the cytotoxic behavior of layered MXenes materials. The most important result of our work is the identiﬁcation of 2D MXenes speciﬁc surface parameters as responsible for the potential cytotoxicity of these materials, in particular, the presence of transition metal oxides and Lithium atoms on the surface. After successful veriﬁcation of the correct predictions of our model, we have also succeeded in predicting toxicity for 2D MXenes not tested in vitro. Hence, we have been able to complement the existing knowledge coming from in vitro studies. Conclusions : Our results allow for the future selection of synthesis methods preventing surface oxidation, which should allow production of non-toxic 2D MXenes. Such materials might ﬁnd application in many ﬁelds of science and technology, especially in biotechnology and nanomedicine.","2020-02-14","2022-03-22 10:13:44","2022-03-22 10:13:44","2022-03-22 10:13:44","","","","","","","","","","","","In Review","","en","","preprint","","","DOI.org (Crossref)","","DOI: 10.21203/rs.2.23632/v1","","/Users/mac/Zotero/storage/9MGX72TK/Marchwiany et al. - 2020 - Predicting the cytotoxicity of MXenes - layered ma.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Sejak tahun 2004, BMKG telah berupaya melakukan penelitian untuk prakiraan cuaca jangka pendek dengan menggunakan data komponen cuaca Numerical Weather Prediction (NWP). Namun output NWP masih sering bias, sehingga perlu dilakukan pra-pemrosesan. Salah satunya menggunakan Model Output Statistics (MOS). MOS merupakan pemodelan observasi cuaca dengan output NWP berbasis regresi. Observasi yang digunakan sebagai variabel respon adalah curah hujan dengan 5 kategori yakni cerah berawan, hujan ringan, hujan sedang, hujan lebat, dan hujan lebat sekali. Output NWP yang digunakan ada 32 variabel. Sebelumnya setiap variabel NWP dilakukan reduksi dimensi dalam sembilan grid menggunakan Principal Component Analysis (PCA). Metode yang digunakan untuk mengklasifikasikan curah hujan adalah klasifikasi pohon. Hasil dari PCA disimpulkan bahwa sebagian besar komponen utama yang terbentuk dari setiap variabel NWP adalah sebanyak satu komponen. Secara keseluruhan, hasil ketepatan klasifikasi curah hujan terbesar menggunakan data testing terletak pada stasiun pengamatan Pondok Betung. Hasil ketepatan klasifikasi data testing sebelum proses SMOTE pada stasiun pengamatan Citeko, Kemayoran, dan Pondok Betung yakni 100%, 85,71% dan 71,43%. Setelah proses Synthetic Minority Oversampling Technique (SMOTE), ketepatan klasifikasi ketiga stasiun pengamatan cenderung turun yakni 28,57%, 85,71% dan 57,14%. Berdasarkan hasil ketepatan klasifikasi data testing untuk setiap stasiun pengamatan, maka pohon klasifikasi yang layak untuk klasifikasi curah hujan adalah model klasifikasi pohon optimal yang sebelum diproses menggunakan SMOTE. ================================================================= A weather condition in Indonesia was announced for a period of about 24 hours using the weather forecast on the analysis of the Meteorology, Climatology and Geophysics (BMKG). Since 2004, BMKG has attempted to do research on short-term weather forecasting using weather component data Numerical Weather Prediction (NWP). But output NWP is still biased, so it is necessary to pre-processing using Model Output Statistics (MOS). MOS is modeling regression-based between weather observations and output NWP. Variable response is precipitation with 5 categories namely cloudy, light rain, moderate rain, heavy rain, and heavy rains all. There are 32 variables of output NWP. Dimension reduction performed on each variable of NWP in nine grids using Principal Component Analysis (PCA). The method used to classify the rainfall is a classification tree. The result of PCA was concluded that most of the major components formed from each variable NWP is as much as one component. Overall, the result of the classification accuracy of the heaviest rainfall using testing data is located in Pondok Betung. The results of testing the accuracy of data classification before the process SMOTE the observation station Citeko, Kemayoran, and Pondok Betung ie 100%, 85.71% and 71.43%. After the process Synthetic Minority Oversampling Technique (SMOTE), third classification accuracy of observation stations tends to fall ie 28.57%, 85.71% and 57.14%. Based on the results of testing the accuracy of data classification for each observation station, the classification tree eligible for classification of precipitation is optimal classification tree models before being processed using SMOTE.","2017-01-19","2022-03-22 10:13:55","2022-03-22 10:13:55","2022-03-22 10:13:55","","","","","","","","","","","","Institut Teknologi Sepuluh Nopember","","id","","Undergraduate","","","repository.its.ac.id","","","","/Users/mac/Zotero/storage/3ULHCATA/Azmi - 2017 - Prediksi curah hujan melalui Model Output Statisti.pdf; /Users/mac/Zotero/storage/KSA8K8B5/3294.html","","","","","","","Sutikno, -","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Diantara penyakit jantung, infark miokard merupakan bentuk yang paling berbahaya diantara penyakit jantung koroner dengan angka kematian yang paling tinggi. Infark miokard dapat didiagnosis melalui pemeriksaan elektrokardiogram (EKG) yang merupakan grafik rekaman pencatatan aktivitas listrik jantung melalui elektroda yang ditempatkan di permukaan tubuh. Penelitian ini bertujuan untuk mengklasifikasi kondisi jantung normal dengan infark miokard, kardiomiopati, disritmia, dan blokade cabang berkas melalui sinyal EKG. Basis data yang digunakan dalam penelitian ini adalah Physionet: The Physikalisch-Technische Bundesanstalt (PTB), National Metrology Institute of Germany yang bisa diakses secara publik. Metode konvensional machine learning (pembelajaran mesin) diusulkan oleh penelitian-penelitian sebelumnya. Namun keterbatasan metode machine learning adalah model harus terus diberikan data dan melibatkan campur tangan manusia (hand-crafted) untuk menghasilkan prediksi yang akurat. Metode machine learning masih direkayasa dengan arsitektur pembelajaran fitur yang dangkal (shallow feature learning). Untuk penelitian ini, metode klasifikasi dengan teknik deep learning (pembelajaran mendalam), Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) berbasis Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) diusulkan. Penelitian ini melakukan studi pembandingan dengan metode RNN, LSTM dan Bidirectional LSTM. Dari fine-tuning hyperparameter ketiga model tersebut, LSTM menunjukkan hasil kinerja klasifikasi dengan akurasi, sensitivitas, spesifisitas, presisi, dan F1 score, masing-masing 98,31%, 96,34%, 98,52%, 92,22%, dan 94,22%. Struktur LSTM dan hyper-parameter yang disarankan dari hasil pelatihan dan pengujian untuk klasifikasi biner dan multikelas adalah dengan menggunakan fungsi aktivasi sel tanh di input gates, fungsi aktivasi sigmoid di output gates, fungsi aktivasi softmax di lapisan output, fungsi loss categorical cross entropy, learning rate 0,001, dengan jumlah 100 epochs.","2019-08-22","2022-03-22 10:14:11","2022-03-22 10:14:11","2022-03-22 10:14:11","","98","","","","","","","","","","Sriwijaya University","","id","cc_public_domain","magister","","","repository.unsri.ac.id","","DOI: 10/RAMA_55101_09042681822002%20-%200002085908_0003126664_07_lamp.pdf","","/Users/mac/Zotero/storage/5RD2QFUK/6188.html","","","","","","","Nurmaini, Siti; Adam, Sukemi","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Contrôler la qualité d'un produit nécessite de la mesurer. Le contrôle de cent pourcent des produits est un objectif important pour dépasser les limites du contrôle par prélèvement, dans le cas de défauts liés à des causes exceptionnelles. Cependant, les contraintes industrielles ont limité le déploiement de la mesure des caractéristiques des produits directement au sein des lignes de production. Le déploiement du contrôle visuel humain est limité par sa durée incompatible avec la durée du cycle des productions à haute cadence, par son coût et par sa variabilité. L'intégration de systèmes de vision informatique présente un coût qui les réservent aux productions à hautes valeurs ajoutées. De plus, le contrôle automatique de la qualité de l'aspect des produits reste une thématique de recherche ouverte.Notre travail a pour objectifs de répondre à ces contraintes, dans le cadre du procédé d'injection-moulage des thermoplastiques.Nous proposons un système de contrôle qui est non invasif pour le procédé de production. Les pièces sont contrôlées dès la sortie de la presse à injecter.Nous étudierons l'apport de l'imagerie non-conventionnelle. La thermographie d'une pièce moulée chaude permet d'obtenir une information sur sa géométrie, qui est complémentaire de l'imagerie conventionnelle. La polarimétrie permet de discriminer les défauts de courbure des surfaces qui modifient l'angle de polarisation de la lumière réfléchie, des défauts de la structure de la matière qui diffusent la lumière.De plus, les cahiers des charges des produits présentent de plus en plus d'exigences tant sur les géométries complexes que sur l'aspect. Cependant, les caractéristiques d'aspect sont difficiles à formaliser. Pour automatiser le contrôle d'aspect, il est nécessaire de modéliser la notion de qualité d'une pièce. Afin d'exploiter les mesures réalisées sur les pièces chaudes, notre approche utilise des méthodes d'apprentissage statistique. Ainsi, l'expert humain qui connait la notion de qualité d'une pièce transmet son savoir au système, par l'annotation d'un jeu de données d'apprentissage. Notre système de contrôle apprend alors une métrique de la qualité d'une pièce, à partir des données brutes issues capteurs. Nous avons privilégier une approche par réseaux de convolution profonds (textit{Deep Learning}) afin d'obtenir les meilleurs performances en justesse de discrimination des pièces conformes. La faible quantité d'échantillons annotés disponible dans notre contexte industrielle nous ont amenée à utiliser des méthodes d'apprentissage par transfert de domaine.Enfin, afin de répondre à l'ensemble des contraintes, nous avons réalisé l'intégration verticale d'une prototype de dispositif de mesure des pièces et de la solution logicielle de traitement par apprentissage statistique.Le dispositif intègre l'imagerie thermique, polarimétrique, l'éclairage et le système de traitement embarqué nécessaire à l'envoi des données sur un serveur d'analyse distant.Deux cas d'applications permettent d'évaluer les performances et la viabilité de la solution proposée","2020-03-09","2022-03-22 10:14:20","2022-03-22 10:14:20","2022-03-22 10:14:20","","","","","","","Contrôle automatique non-invasif de la qualité des produits","","","","","Université Savoie Mont Blanc","","fr","","phdthesis","","","tel.archives-ouvertes.fr","","","","/Users/mac/Zotero/storage/V894WSTT/Nagorny - 2020 - Contrôle automatique non-invasif de la qualité des.pdf; /Users/mac/Zotero/storage/I8YQLA4R/tel-03181778.html","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Apesar de conhecermos a estrutura tridimencional de muitas proteínas, para a maioria delas, não possuímos uma compreensão suficiente para descrever em detalhes como a estrutura se organiza a partir da sequência de aminoácidos. É bem conhecido que a formação de núcleos de estruturas locais, conhecida como estrutura secundária, apresenta papel fundamental no enovelamento final da proteína. Desta forma, o desenvolvimento de métodos que permitam não somente predizer a estrutura secundária adotada por um dado resíduo, mas também, a maneira como esse processo deve ocorrer ao longo do tempo é muito relevante em várias áreas da biologia estrutural. Neste trabalho, desenvolvemos dois métodos de predição de estruturas secundárias utilizando modelos com o potencial de fornecer informações mais detalhadas sobre o processo de predição. Um desses modelos foi construído utilizando autômatos celulares, um tipo de modelo dinâmico onde é possível obtermos informações espaciais e temporais. O outro modelo foi desenvolvido utilizando redes neurais residuais profundas. Com este modelo é possível extrair informações espaciais e probabilísticas de suas múltiplas camadas internas de convolução, o que parece refletir, em algum sentido, os estados de formação da estrutura secundária durante o enovelamento. A acurácia da predição obtida por esse modelo foi de ~78% para os resíduos que apresentaram consenso na estrutura atribuída pelos métodos DSSP, STRIDE, KAKSI e PROSS. Tal acurácia, apesar de inferior à obtida pelo PSIPRED, o qual utiliza matrizes PSSM como entrada, é superior à obtida por outros métodos que realizam a predição de estruturas secundárias diretamente a partir da sequência de aminoácidos.","2018-03-15","2022-03-22 10:16:13","2022-03-22 10:16:13","2022-03-22 10:16:13","","","","","","","","","","","","Universidade de São Paulo","","pt-br","","text","","","www.teses.usp.br","","DOI: 10.11606/T.95.2018.tde-03052018-095932","","/Users/mac/Zotero/storage/I84L5KQT/Pereira - 2018 - Redes neurais residuais profundas e autômatos celu.pdf; /Users/mac/Zotero/storage/DDMQVJQV/en.html","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""
